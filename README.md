This python script, or pipe dream, determines which stocks might be undervalued (based on pricetobook, pegratio, dividends, and other notes from Investopedia)

== Value Investing Notes (primarily derived from Investopedia) ==

[QUANTITATIVE]

1. price-to-book (P/B) ratio - experts say value under 1.33 is potentially good (undervalued stock), assuming the company is not in financial hardship.

2. price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio - shows the company's track record for earnings to determine if the stock price is not reflecting all of the earnings or undervalued.

(a) Average value for S&P 500 is 25 (still doesn't objectively mean much)

(b) "Historically, the PE for the entire U.S. stock market is about 15" (still doesn't objectively mean much):

(c) "In theory, by taking the median of P/E ratios over a period of several years, one could formulate something of a standardized P/E ratio, which could then be seen as a benchmark and used to indicate whether or not a stock is worth buying."

(d) price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio - The PEG ratio is calculated as a company’s trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio divided by the growth rate of its earnings for a specified time period. A stock with a PEG ratio of less than 1 is typically considered undervalued

3. Free cash flow (FCF) - cash generated from a company's revenue or operations after the costs of expenditures have been subtracted.

(a) While FCF is a useful tool, it is not subject to the same financial disclosure requirements as other line items in the financial statements.

(b) A common approach is to use the stability of FCF trends as a measure of risk.

[QUALITATIVE]

1. Insider Buying and Selling - A company’s managers and directors have unique knowledge about the companies they run, so if they are purchasing its stock, it’s reasonable to assume that the company’s prospects look favorable.

2. Analyze Earnings Reports - annual (preferred) and quarterly via SEC

3. Analyze Financial Reports - The balance sheet consists of two sections, one listing the company’s assets and another listing its liabilities and equity.

4. Retained earnings - used to pay dividends, for example, and is considered a sign of a healthy, profitable company.

5. Brand and company culture.
